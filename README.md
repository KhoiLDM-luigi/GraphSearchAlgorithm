# GraphSearchAlgorithm
This is a school project about graph (problem)searching in AI, containing Depth First Search, Breath First Search, Uniform Cost Search, A-star Search, Greedy Best First Search
Note: Graphical alogrithm presentation source code is not mine

*program's command line argument*: Main.py <test-case-file-path> <algorithm> <time-delay>(optional)
  
  + <algorithm>: 'bfs' - Breath First Search; 'dfs' - Depth First Search, 'ucs' - Uniform Cost Search; 'astar' - A-star Search, 'greedy' - Greedy Best First Search
    
  + All searching algorithm return a first in first out type list of vistied node and path node
*addtional module*: pygame, matplotlib, numpy, networkx
